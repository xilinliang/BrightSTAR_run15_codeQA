Here are the instruction to run the analysis.

Special note 1: After you open a new terminal or re-login to the RCAS node, please run command: source setup.csh

Special note 2: All the command for this analysis framework are required to run at this current folder! Do not run commands at any sub-directory!

Part 1: set up the environment and compile the analysis code.

 run the following command:

 source setup.csh

 ./onetime_setup.csh

 make all

Part 2(optional): generate the NanoDst , the analysis tree for this study

  Convert MuDst to NanoDst and only keep the useful information for this study

  Note: In this study, the NanoDst files are merged fill by fill. You will see 53 NanoDst files. If you want to reproduce any of the NanoDst file for the fill, it could be possible that there will be some minor difference due to the inaccessable of MuDst files in Distributed Disk (xrdroot)

  Therefore, I will suggest you to use one MuDst file within the list of /star/data01/pwg/liangxl/BrightSTAR_run15/run15FMSfilelist/ to check

      root4star

      RunDiffJetTreeMaker_FMS("$MuDst", "$NanoDst", $fillNumber, "fms")

Part 3: submit jobs to do the event delection and count the yields for each bin to prepare for calculating the A_N as well as the systematic uncertainty.

  run the following command to submit jobs. Tips: we suggest to use different node to submit jobs with each of the commands below.

  ./submit_job/SD_submit.csh

  ./submit_job/RG_submit.csh

  ./submit_job/SE_submit.csh

  ./submit_job/generate_Inc_job.csh Inc

Part 4: calculate the A_N and its systematic uncertainty

  run the following command to merge the root files, calculate the A_N and its systematic uncertainty for single diffractive events, rapidity gap events and semi-exclusive events

  ./analysis_code/hadd.csh

  ./analysis_code/SD/all/analysis_SD_all.csh

  ./analysis_code/SD/12np/analysis_SD_12np.csh

  ./analysis_code/SD/3pnp/analysis_SD_3pnp.csh

  ./analysis_code/RG/all/analysis_RG_all.csh

  ./analysis_code/RG/12np/analysis_RG_12np.csh

  ./analysis_code/RG/3pnp/analysis_RG_3pnp.csh

  ./analysis_code/SE/analysis_SE.csh

Part 5: draw the money plots

   Fig 2: A_N for Rapidity Gap events

       root -b -q analysis_code/PLBpaperplots/draw_AN_compare_diff_3mults_RG_combined.C

   Fig 3: A_N for single diffractive process

       root -b -q analysis_code/PLBpaperplots/draw_AN_compare_diff_3mults_SD_combined.C

   Fig 4: Cross section fraction

       root -b -q analysis_code/PLBpaperplots/Calc_cross_section.C

   Fig 5: Comparison plot of A_N for inclusive, single diffractive, and rapidity gap events

       root -b -q analysis_code/PLBpaperplots/draw_AN_compare_inc_SD_RG_combined_V2.C

   Fig 6: A_N for semi-exclusive process

       root -b -q analysis_code/PLBpaperplots/draw_12np_ANplot_5pointsW.C

   After you run the code, you will find the figures in fig/PLBpaperplot/ folder
